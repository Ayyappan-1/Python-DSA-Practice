# Python-DSA-Practice 

This repository is created for python Data Structures and Algorithm practice, every piece of code is updated cleanly with time complexity and space complexity. Each concept is updated topic by topic in respective folders in a proper structure.


## Start Date 

 - 11th Dec 2025

## Objective 
 1. To understand and implement Data Structures and Algorithms concepts.
 2. Build a strong foundation for python.
 3. Deep understanding and hands on experience on problem solving.
 4. Building confidence and displine in programming daily. 
 5. Being the better version of ourselves everyday by improving 1% everyday. 


## Structure 
- Each topic is a folder which has its concept problems  stored inside them.
- Every topic is driven deeper with problem solving and core idea problems.  
- There is a separate folder named Weekly_Progress/ which stores reports for every week. 


## Goal 
- Every day I will solve two problems and commit them on the same day consistantly.
- Weekly plans are well definied and topics are given as goals to complete within the week. 
- Monthly tracking and improvements will be done as per analysis and self understanding. 


## How I work 
- Every day start with two problems.
- First I will understand what the problem is and how we humans solve it by mathematical or logical thinking.
- Later I will try to implement my own program and I managed to reach brute force without internet help as I know the fundamentals of python already.
- I will find the time and space complexity of the code and check for minor checks and think for optmized method.
- I search the algorithm and learn the steps deeply and try to implement. 
- Later write command lines for time and space complexity and commit the changes and push it to the repository. 


## Resources 
- Topics in GeeksforGeeks
- AI agents for better understanding and doubts solving.
- Youtube for understanding optimized algorithms for problems.
- It is more than enough for me to understand the steps deeply and reflect it in code. 


## Progress report 
- Weekly goals.
- Problems solved.
- Topics covered.
- Key learnings and improvements.
- Reports are stored in the weekly-reports/ directory.
