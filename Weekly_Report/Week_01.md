## Blockers  
1. Poor time management (Action : To fix a time for DSA everyday)
2. Tiny drawbacks in concepts due to new environment ( Action : Consistency )
3. Working day with online acedamical test made a incomplete day (Action : Preplanning of acedimical works)

 
## Self-Critique 
- Excited to move forward.
- I need more consistency. 
- Missed one day.
- The goal is to achieve, not just to fix. 


## Delayed Weekly report 
- First two Weeks went unaware and mainly focused in completion rather then documenting hence it is consolidated retrospectively.
- During the period we continued to commit regularly and tried our best to complete the weekly task without any lame excuses.
