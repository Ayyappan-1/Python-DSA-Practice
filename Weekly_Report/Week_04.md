# Week-04

## Start 
- 1.1.2026


## End  
- 7.1.2026


## Fixed Goal 
1. Deep Knowledge about linked list. 
2. Implementation of queue and stack concepts.
3. Completion of 14 problems and commit them. 
4. Take proper notes. 
5. Slowly start problem solving in popular website.


## Completion 
- Element searching in linked list
- Length and middle element of linked list
- Reversing a linked list
- Cycle detection in a linked list
- Array implementation of stack
- Linked list implementation of stack
- Checking parenthesis balance by stack
- Stack based palindrome checking
- Array implementation of queue
- Linked list implementation of queue
- Factorial by recusion technique
- Finding Power of a number by recursion 
- Sum of N natural numbers 

- Total Commits 13 / 10 (Crossed the goal)


## Next Week Goal 
1. Diving in recursion concepts. 
2. Implementation of sorting algorithms.
3. Completion of 14 problems and commit them. 
4. Take proper notes. 
5. Starting problem solving in popular website(Strictly follow).


## Blockers 
1. Personal works for some days. 


## Critique 
- Maintained full week streak.
- Learned extra concepts in recursion and committed with breaking goal's. 
- Implemented Proper timing for DSA Everyday.  
- Slightly confused with recursion so planned to study it more deeply. 
- I think we are moving steady and consistent then before.
