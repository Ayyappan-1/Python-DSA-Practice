## Next Week Goal
1. Exploring the world of Non-Linear data structure. 
2. Understanding the theory deeply then coding. 
3. Proper notes and updates. 


## Blockers
None


## Critique
- Maintained Full week streak.
- Understood that swimming in linear data structure won't increase survival. 
- Sorting algorithms is not easy and need more patience to complete. 
- Hard work with consistency helped me to manage even with festival stuffs. 
- Re-allocated files in separate folder for searching related problems and algorithms.
- In short a long bad week filled with tough mind blowing algorithms. 
- Still maintaining non-memorizing and baby teaching techniques to confirm knowledge grasping.
