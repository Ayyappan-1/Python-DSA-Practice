## Next Week Goal 
1. Alternative String and Array Concepts.
2. Searching algorithms (Linear and Binary Search).
2. Completion of 10 problems and commit them. 
3. Take proper notes. 


## Blockers 
1. Got Fever (Action : Unavoidable Health Issues Hence Trying Compensating  On Upcoming Days).
2. Continued stuggles to keep up consistency.


## Critique 
- One missing day due to fever, tried to compensate by learning concept of rotations. 
- Learned the flow but still lag with consistency.
- Implemented Proper timing for DSA Everyday.
- Started to think about tackling acedamic pressure.
- Decreased limits according to reality.


## Delayed Weekly report 
- First two Weeks went unaware and mainly focused in completion rather then documenting hence it is consolidated retrospectively.
- During the period we continued to commit regularly and tried our best to complete the weekly task without any lame excuses.
